  <h2> Nader's Come Up </h2>
  <p> Nader was born here in Highlands Ranch, Colorado. He lived here with his family until Nader was 7 years old when he made the big move over to Dubai. Nader visited every summer to visit his friends and family. Also Nader would come back to get out of the hot Dubai heat. Nader’s family decided to make the move back to Highlands Ranch this year because his dad had to keep up with the family’s dealership</p>.
